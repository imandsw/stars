      <h1>My Beautiful Poems</h1>
      <div class="poem">
        <h2>Long time</h2>
        <p>
          In shadows of my heart, a longing grows,
For someone missed, a soul that knows,
But fear entwines, like a tangled vine,
Keeping us apart, your touch not mine.
        </p>
I yearn for moments that we once shared,
A bond so deep, a love so rare,
But caution whispers, its voice so strong,
What if I'm mistaken, what if I'm wrong?
<p>
The distance lingers, a chasm wide,
Between the truth and fears I hide,
Afraid of missteps, of misplaced desire,
I keep my heart guarded, my soul on fire.
</p>
Yet memories dance, like flickering light,
Igniting emotions that burn so bright,
I wonder if you feel the same way too,
If thoughts of me still dance within you.
<p>
But doubts take hold, like a tempest's roar,
Am I merely dreaming, longing for more?
Afraid that I'm clinging to an image in my mind,
A perfected version, an ideal I find.
</p>
So here I stand, with words unspoken,
A heart in yearning, forever broken,
For distance keeps us in separate spheres,
Yet in my heart, you're still so near.
<p>
I miss the laughter, the shared delight,
The moments we cherished, day or night,
But I'll keep my distance, this silent plea,
To protect my heart, to set you free.
</p>
For in the realm of uncertainty and doubt,
Sometimes it's best to live without,
To honor the memories, the love we knew,
And cherish the moments that were shared by two.
<p>
So I'll keep my distance, though it tears me apart,
Holding onto hope, a delicate art,
And if fate allows, our paths may cross,
In a future where understanding's not lost.
</p><p>
Until then, I'll cherish you from afar,
A shining star, my guiding star,
And in my heart's whispers, you'll always remain,
A cherished memory, a love untouched by pain.
        </p>
