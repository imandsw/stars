      <h1>My Beautiful Poems</h1>
      <div class="poem">
        <h2>Long time</h2>
        <p>
          In shadows of my heart, a longing grows,
For someone missed, a soul that knows,
But fear entwines, like a tangled vine,
Keeping us apart, your touch not mine.
        </p>
I yearn for moments that we once shared,
A bond so deep, a love so rare,
But caution whispers, its voice so strong,
What if I'm mistaken, what if I'm wrong?
<p>
The distance lingers, a chasm wide,
Between the truth and fears I hide,
Afraid of missteps, of misplaced desire,
I keep my heart guarded, my soul on fire.
</p>
Yet memories dance, like flickering light,
Igniting emotions that burn so bright,
I wonder if you feel the same way too,
If thoughts of me still dance within you.
<p>
But doubts take hold, like a tempest's roar,
Am I merely dreaming, longing for more?
Afraid that I'm clinging to an image in my mind,
A perfected version, an ideal I find.
</p>
So here I stand, with words unspoken,
A heart in yearning, forever broken,
For distance keeps us in separate spheres,
Yet in my heart, you're still so near.
<p>
I miss the laughter, the shared delight,
The moments we cherished, day or night,
But I'll keep my distance, this silent plea,
To protect my heart, to set you free.
</p>
For in the realm of uncertainty and doubt,
Sometimes it's best to live without,
To honor the memories, the love we knew,
And cherish the moments that were shared by two.
<p>
So I'll keep my distance, though it tears me apart,
Holding onto hope, a delicate art,
And if fate allows, our paths may cross,
In a future where understanding's not lost.
</p><p>
Until then, I'll cherish you from afar,
A shining star, my guiding star,
And in my heart's whispers, you'll always remain,
A cherished memory, a love untouched by pain.

        <h1> Another day </h1>
        <p>
          In the realm of life's purpose, where questions reside,
          I find solace in moments by loved ones' side.
          Though the meaning eludes, like a mist in the air,
          Their happiness beckons, a painting I'll share.
        </p>
        <p>
          With strokes of affection, I'll craft every line,
          Portraits of joy, where their smiles intertwine. 
          In colors vibrant, emotions will ignite,
          As love intertwines with each brushstroke's light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like a tapestry woven, our stories entwined,
I'll paint their laughter, each memory defined.
Through shared experiences, a masterpiece born,
A testament to bonds that will never be torn.
        </p>
        <p>
The canvas unfurls, an ethereal scene,
A kaleidoscope of love, vibrant and serene.
With patience and care, I'll bring each detail alive,
Each stroke a testament, a love that will thrive.
        </p>
The sun's golden rays will dance on their faces,
As their laughter echoes in the sweetest embraces.
In their eyes, I'll capture a sparkle so rare,
A reflection of moments we were privileged to share.
      <p>
Through life's ups and downs, when the path becomes rough,
This painting will remind us that love is enough.
For in their happiness, I'll find my own peace,
As colors and laughter bring purpose's release.
      </p>
        <p>
So let me be an artist, with passion aflame,
Brushing strokes of joy, forever to acclaim.
For in the happiness of those I hold dear,
I discover life's meaning, crystal clear.
